    <h3>What is Sisig?</h3>
    <p>Sizzling sisig is a Kapampangan delicacy usually served as an appetizer but has evolved over the years into a popular dinner entree. Although traditionally made with grilled pig face and ears, different adaptations using flaked fish, seafood, tofu, and other cuts of meat such as chicken and crispy lechon kawali are also common.</p>

    <h4>How to Cook Sisig</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>If using chicken livers, place in a countertop blender and process until smooth. Transfer puréed livers to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate.
            </li>
            <li>If using pork shoulder, blot dry with paper towels, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, then proceed to Step 3. If using pig ears, snout, and/or jowl, place pork in stockpot or Dutch oven, cover with water and boil until tender, between 60 to 90 minutes. Using tongs, transfer pig ears, snout, and/or jowl to a rimmed baking sheet and set aside until cool enough to handle. Blot dry with paper towels and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, then proceed to Step 3.
            </li>
            <li>Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet lined with a double layer of paper towels. In a wok, heat 2 cups (475ml) oil over medium-high heat until it registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Working in 3 batches, carefully lower a third of the pork shoulder, pig ears, snout, and/or jowl into the oil and fry until lightly browned all over, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer pork to prepared rack. Return oil to 375°F (190°C) and repeat with remaining pork. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and golden brown in color, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add reserved fried pork, puréed chicken livers (if using), soy sauce, calamansi juice, and chiles, and mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Break eggs directly into pan, spacing them evenly around perimeter. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook, without stirring, until egg whites are opaque and yolks are runny but turning yellow on the edges, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add mayonnaise and scallions and mix with pork and eggs until fully combined. Serve immediately with cooked white rice and calamansi halves.
            </li>
        </ol>
